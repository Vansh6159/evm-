Overview
The MyToken smart contract is a simple implementation of an ERC20-like token on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for minting and burning of tokens, keeping track of balances, and storing basic token details.

Features
Public variables for storing token details (name, abbreviation, and total supply)
Mapping of addresses to their balances
Minting function to create new tokens
Burning function to destroy existing tokens
Contract Details
Public Variables
string public tokenName: Stores the name of the token (e.g., "Elon").
string public tokenAbbrv: Stores the abbreviation of the token (e.g., "MUSK").
uint public totalSupply: Stores the total supply of tokens.
Mapping
mapping (address => uint) public balances: Maps each address to its token balance.
Functions
mint(address _address, uint _value) public:
Increases the total supply by _value.
Increases the balance of _address by _value.
burn(address _address, uint _value) public:
Decreases the total supply by _value.
Decreases the balance of _address by _value, provided _address has at least _value tokens.
Reverts the transaction if _address does not have enough tokens to burn.
Usage
Minting Tokens:

Call the mint function with the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to mint.
Example: mint(0x123..., 100) will mint 100 tokens to the address 0x123....
Burning Tokens:

Call the burn function with the address and the amount of tokens to burn.
Example: burn(0x123..., 50) will burn 50 tokens from the address 0x123... if the address has sufficient balance.
Deployment
To deploy the MyToken contract, use any Solidity-compatible Ethereum development environment like Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle.

Open the chosen development environment.
Copy and paste the contract code into a new Solidity file.
Compile the contract.
Deploy the contract to the desired Ethereum network.
Notes
Ensure you have sufficient ETH for gas fees when deploying and interacting with the contract.
